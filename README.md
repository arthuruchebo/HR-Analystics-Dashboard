# HR-Analystics-Dashboard
An interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Python, Faker, Tableau, and Figma to generate insights on hiring trends, employee turnover, salary distribution, and pay gaps.

## Project Overview
This project simulates HR data using Python's Faker library and visualises key workforce metrics through an interactive Tableau dashboard. The dashboard's design was planned using Figma for a clean and intuitive layout.

## Key Features
Synthetic HR Data: Generated a realistic yet fake dataset using Python and Faker.
Dashboard Design: Created a visually appealing background in Figma for a polished look.
Interactive Visualisation: Built in Tableau to explore hiring, retention, and salary distribution trends.
AI-Assisted Code Writing: Some Python scripts were generated with the help of Generative AI prompts.

## Technologies Used
Python (Faker, Pandas)
Draw.io
Tableau
Figma
